# Dice test

## Scripts

### Run the project

``git clone https://github.com/jeffoufe/dice-test.git``
`` npm install``
``npm run start``

### Typecheck the project

## Technologies used

- React
- Redux (to manage the state)
- SASS (for styling)
- Flow (for typechecking)
- Axios (to call the API)

## Improvements to make

- UI doesn't look great when 5 event cards per line displayed
- Infinite scroll
- Create an API reducer to factor API calls' states (loading, data, error)
- Autocompletion for the search input
	- Previous searches
	- Venue suggestions
- End to end testing (using Cypress)
